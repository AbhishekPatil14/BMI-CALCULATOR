The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a widely used measure to determine whether an individual is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. It is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. For instance, if someone weighs 70 kilograms and is 1.75 meters tall, their BMI would be approximately 22.86, which falls within the normal weight range. According to standard categories, a BMI of less than 18.5 indicates underweight, a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 denotes normal weight, a BMI between 25 and 29.9 signifies overweight, and a BMI of 30 or above indicates obesity. These categories help in assessing potential health risks associated with body weight. For a quick and accurate calculation, many online tools are available where you can simply input your height and weight to find your BMI and corresponding weight category.
